- Install TestNG on Eclipse through Install New Software feature, add TestNG to buildpath
- Run testng.xml to start the test
- One script will run on both Chrome and Firefox
- Check folder test-output -> emailable-report.html for the test result
- Currently the script will fail due to following reasons:
+ The encoding for Celsius degree between the temperature displayed on search result and in detailed information are different 
=> this will always happen currently. The encoding on search result return for example 27Â°? - the "C" character has encoding issue
+ The temperature between what displayed on search result and what displayed in detailed information can be different (due to application)
+ The time displayed in detailed information and the time get can be different by 1 minute (rarely happen)
